# Feedback on Frontend

- Not exactly intuitive with the borrowing rates, deposit rate, and the borrow and deposit button all on the same  
  space.
- Should automatically switch to required network
- unnecessary scroll bars
- value in dollars for internal swapping should be visible to keep track of assets
- after i repay my loan what happens to the assets i buy from within the contract
